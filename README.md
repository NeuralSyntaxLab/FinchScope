============

## Overview

FreedomScope is an umbrella project for several customizable and scaleable single-photon fluorescent imaging microscope systems that take advantage of developing open-source landscape to provide a modular in-vivo  all optical neurophysiology rigs with a transparent hardware, and  acquisition and analysis software.


You can read more about the project [here.](http://iopscience.iop.org/1741-2552/14/4/045001/)

The project was developed by [Will Liberti](https://github.com/WALIII) in the [Gardner Lab](http://people.bu.edu/timothyg/Home.html), for multi-month imaging of neural activity in songbirds [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002158) [[2]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4405) [[3]](https://ccneuro.org/2018/proceedings/1133.pdf) bats, and rodents. This effort would not have been possible without the critical advice and support at the outset of the project by Daniel Aharoni and Peyman Golshani, of the [UCLA Miniscope project](http://miniscope.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

#### Components:


### Finchscope Microscope

The FinchScope is a lightweight wireless-capable microscope for biological imaging- Designed specifically for monitoring the neural activity (via genetically encoded calcium indicators) of zebra finches while they sing their courtship songs. You can find the Construction and Assembly Guide for [the Microscope](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/Assembly-Guide), As well as a for the [Data Acquisition Box (DAQ)](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/DAQ-Guide).  Also, we have a [Guide Through a Basic Analysis Pipeline](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/Analysis-Guide)

#### Wireless Finchscope
The FinchScope is wireless capable and is being used in bats with the Yartsev lab. additional resources related to this project can be found (here.)https://github.com/WALIII/ImBat

### 1P2C Microscope (Under Development)
The 1P2C Miniscope is a variant of the FinchScope that incorporates a second excitation path for dual color imaging, or for widefield photo- stimulation.  You can find the Construction and Assembly Guide for [the Microscope](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/Assembly-Guide), As well as a for the [Data Acquisition Box (DAQ)](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/DAQ-Guide).


### Widefield Microscope (Under Development)
The WideField miniature microscope weighs 4g and gives a 4x3mm field of view. You can find the Construction and Assembly Guide for [the Microscope](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/Assembly-Guide), As well as a for the [Data Acquisition Box (DAQ)](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/DAQ-Guide).


### Active Commutator
The [Active Commutator](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/Commutators) is a low cost, low noise, active (driven by a motor and sensor) electrical rotary joint designed for electrophysiology (single and multichannel micro-electrode arrays) and optophysiology ( optogenetics, miniature microscopes, and fiber photometry).
